Linux Directory Tricks (Where to Find What)

1. Config Files → /etc/

Examples:
/etc/nginx/           # Nginx configs
/etc/ssh/sshd_config  # SSH server settings
/etc/fstab            # Filesystem mounts

Trick: Think "ETCetera = Everything To Configure"

2. Logs → /var/log/

Examples:
/var/log/syslog    # System logs
/var/log/nginx/    # Nginx logs
/var/log/auth.log  # Authentication logs

Trick: "VARiable data keeps LOGging history"

3. Application Data → /var/lib/

Examples:
/var/lib/mysql/    # MySQL databases
/var/lib/docker/   # Docker containers
/var/lib/apt/      # APT package metadata

Trick: "LIBraries store app DATA"

Note: logs and App Data stores in /Var/  its common path

4. User-Specific Configs → ~/.config/ or ~/.*  (stores in HOME)

Examples:
~/.bashrc              # Shell config
~/.ssh/                # SSH keys
~/.config/gtk-3.0/     # GUI app settings

Trick: "DOT files hide in your HOME"

Pro Tips for Interviews

Exceptions:
Kernel: /boot/ and /proc/
Temporary Files: /tmp/ and /var/tmp/
Binaries: /usr/bin/ (user) vs /sbin/ (system)

Quick Verification:
ls -l /etc/ | grep nginx   # Check config locations
find /var/log -name "*.log" # List all log files

Modern Systems:
Snap/Flatpak: ~/snap/ or ~/.local/share/flatpak/
Systemd: /etc/systemd/system/ for custom services

Mnemonic Summary
"Every Thing Configured → /etc/
VARiable LOGs → /var/log/
LIBraries hold APP DATA → /var/lib/
DOT files hide at HOME → ~/.*"

-------------------------------------

filesystem

/etc - configuration files of all

/proc - details of systems hardware,component and processes 

/bin - essential binaries used by user for system operations - all commands

/sbin - essential binaries used by system for system administration like reboot, ifconfig , shutdown

/usr - user related program data

/var - data which is variable in size like logs or database

/tmp - temp files by app or system

/home - home directories of all user 

/lib - conatins essential shared libraries required by /bin and /sbin

/mnt - for mounting traditional filesystem

/media - mounting removable media like pen drives

/dev - represents hardware on system and allow sofware to interact with them
       contains device files which represents hardware on system and allow sofware to interact with them like /dev/sda , /dev/null for discard data
