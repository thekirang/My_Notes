 ### 🚀 Why Do We Need Kubernetes?

1. **Auto Scaling & Load Balancing**: It increases or decreases containers based on load automatically.
2. **Container Communication**: It helps containers talk to each other properly.
3. **Management**: Without Kubernetes, managing containers manually is very difficult and risky.

### 🌟 Features of Kubernetes:

1. **Manages Lots of Containers** across different machines.
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Adds or removes containers when needed.
3. **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts containers if they crash.
4. **Load Balancing**: Spreads traffic across containers.
5. **Works Anywhere**: On cloud, local, or hybrid setups.
6. **Fault Tolerant**: If one node/pod fails, it keeps running on others.
7. **Rollback Support**: You can return to older app versions if something goes wrong.
8. **Health Checks**: Monitors container health.
9. **Batch Jobs**: Can run tasks once or on schedule.

### 🧳 How Kubernetes Works (High Level)

A **Kubernetes Cluster** is made of:

* **Master Node(s)**: The brain — manages everything.
* **Worker Node(s)**: The body — runs your app in containers.

---

### 📌 Master Node Responsibilities:

The Master Node runs the **Control Plane**, which includes:

1. **API Server**: The front desk — accepts instructions (YAML files).
2. **ETCD**: The memory — stores the cluster state (key-value format).
3. **Scheduler**: The planner — decides which node runs which pod.
4. **Controller Manager**: The manager — ensures reality matches our plan (desired state).

---

### 🚪 Worker Node Components:

1. **Kubelet**: The supervisor — takes instructions from master and runs containers.
2. **Container Runtime (like Docker)**: Actually runs the container.
3. **Kube Proxy**: The network guy — gives IPs to pods and routes traffic.

---

### 💪 Understanding Pods:

* **Pod** is the smallest unit in Kubernetes (like a wrapper around containers).
* Usually holds **one container**, but can have more.
* **Pods run inside Nodes**.
* Kubernetes does NOT manage containers directly — it manages **Pods**.

#### Multi-Container Pod:

* Shares same IP and storage.
* Good for tightly connected containers.
* All containers in a pod start/stop together.

---

### 🧬 Kubernetes Objects (Important Building Blocks):

1. **Pod**: Runs your container.
2. **ReplicaSet**: Ensures right number of pod copies are running.
3. **Deployment**: Helps with updating apps, rollback, and scaling.
4. **Service**: Makes your app accessible on the network (gives stable IP).
5. **Volume**: Gives long-term storage to pods.

### 📊 Real-World Usage

* **kubectl**: Command-line tool to control Kubernetes.
* **kubeadm**: Used to set up Kubernetes manually on-premise.
* **kube-fed**: Used to connect multiple clusters together.

---

### 🔐 Security and Access

* **RBAC**: Role-based access control — controls who can do what.
* **Secrets**: Store passwords and sensitive info securely.
* **ServiceAccount**: Used by pods to communicate with API securely.

---

### 🥜 Storage

* **PersistentVolume (PV)**: Pre-configured storage.
* **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: Request storage from PV.
* **StorageClass**: Defines types of storage (like fast or slow disks).

---

### 🌐 Networking in Kubernetes:

* **ClusterIP**: Internal service.
* **NodePort**: Opens a fixed port on every node.
* **LoadBalancer**: Used for external access (on cloud providers).
* **DNS**: Every service and pod has an internal DNS name.

---

### 📊 Health & Monitoring:

* **Liveness Probe**: Is the app running?
* **Readiness Probe**: Is the app ready to receive traffic?
* **Startup Probe**: Is the app fully started?
* Tools: Prometheus, Grafana for monitoring

---

### ℹ️ Important Notes:

* YAML file defines **what you want**, Kubernetes makes it happen.
* Kubernetes always tries to match **actual state** with your **desired state**.
* You don't directly manage containers — you manage pods, deployments, etc.
