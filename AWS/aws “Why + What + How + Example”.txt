ðŸ”¹ Amazon EC2
â€¢ Why: Scalable virtual servers in the cloud
â€¢ What: Instance types, EBS volumes, security groups, key pairs
â€¢ How: Launch via CLI/Console, connect with SSH, monitor with CloudWatch
â€¢ Example: Host a Java app on t3.medium with EBS and IAM role

ðŸ”¹ Amazon S3
â€¢ Why: Store unstructured data at scale
â€¢ What: Object storage with 11 9s durability, S3 Vectors, Glacier, Express One Zone
â€¢ How: Use CLI/API, trigger Lambda via events, use vector APIs, Express Zone for low-latency
â€¢ Example: Store user images + embeddings, invoke Lambda to process and cache via CloudFront

ðŸ”¹ Amazon VPC
â€¢ Why: Isolated network environment in AWS
â€¢ What: Subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, internet gateways, security groups, NACLs
â€¢ How: Design public/private subnets, control traffic, use VPC endpoints
â€¢ Example: Web tier in public subnet, DB tier in private subnet behind NAT

ðŸ”¹ Amazon RDS
â€¢ Why: Managed relational databases
â€¢ What: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server; Multi-AZ, read replicas, April RUs
â€¢ How: Provision via Console/CLI, enable backups and auto minor upgrades
â€¢ Example: Use Aurora PostgreSQL with replica for analytics and failover

ðŸ”¹ AWS IAM
â€¢ Why: Control access to AWS securely
â€¢ What: Users, roles, policies, federation, IAM Roles Anywhere, ABAC
â€¢ How: Write attribute-based (ABAC) policies, audit access with Access Analyzer
â€¢ Example: EC2 assumes IAM role for read-only access to S3

ðŸ”¹ Amazon CloudWatch
â€¢ Why: Monitor AWS resources and logs
â€¢ What: Metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards, Live Tail, Application Signals for Lambda
â€¢ How: Send metrics via agent/SDK, create alarms, query logs with Insights
â€¢ Example: Alert on high EC2 CPU usage, trigger Auto Scaling and notify via SNS

ðŸ”¹ AWS Lambda
â€¢ Why: Run code without managing servers
â€¢ What: Multiple runtimes; SnapStart for Python/.NET; response streaming up to 200 MB
â€¢ How: Deploy with CLI/SAM/CDK, trigger from S3/API Gateway, use Live Tail in VS Code
â€¢ Example: On S3 upload, a Python Lambda logs metadata and sends SNS alert

ðŸ”¹ AWS CloudTrail
â€¢ Why: Track AWS API activity for auditing and compliance
â€¢ What: Captures API calls from Console, SDKs, CLI; logs stored in S3
â€¢ How: Enable trail, analyze with Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights
â€¢ Example: Detect unauthorized EC2 actions using CloudTrail logs

ðŸ”¹ AWS Glue DataBrew
â€¢ Why: Visually clean and transform data without code
â€¢ What: 250+ transformations; integrates with S3, Athena, and Redshift
â€¢ How: Connect data, create recipes, preview results, run jobs
â€¢ Example: Clean sales CSV from S3, write cleaned data to Redshift

ðŸ”¹ AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)
â€¢ Why: Distribute traffic across multiple targets
â€¢ What: ALB, NLB, CLB; supports health checks, SSL, sticky sessions
â€¢ How: Create LB, register EC2/Lambda targets, define listeners and rules
â€¢ Example: ALB routes HTTP(S) traffic to EC2s in multiple AZs

ðŸ”¹ Amazon CloudFront
â€¢ Why: Global low-latency content delivery
â€¢ What: CDN with edge caching, WAF, signed URLs, SaaS Manager, VPC Origins
â€¢ How: Set up distribution, use Lambda@Edge, manage multi-sites with SaaS Manager
â€¢ Example: Serve SPA from S3 and secure API backend in VPC via CloudFront

ðŸ”¹ Amazon SNS
â€¢ Why: Send notifications or fan-out messages
â€¢ What: Pub/Sub for email, SMS, Lambda, SQS
â€¢ How: Create topic, subscribe endpoints, publish via Console/CLI/API
â€¢ Example: Trigger SMS alert from CloudWatch alarm using SNS

ðŸ”¹ Amazon Auto Scaling
â€¢ Why: Automatically adjust resource capacity based on demand
â€¢ What: Target tracking, step scaling, scheduled actions; works with EC2, ECS, DynamoDB
â€¢ How: Define scaling policies, integrate with CloudWatch alarms
â€¢ Example: Auto-scale EC2 group when average CPU > 70% for 5 mins
