ðŸš€ HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC) - QUICK NOTES
===========================

1. WHAT IS HPC?
---------------
HPC = Combining multiple computers to solve complex problems faster than one system.
- Multiple CPUs work together using shared memory, storage, and I/O.
- Used to run complex simulations, analytics, and big data tasks.

cluster: its group of nodes (CPU and Memory) then its connected to swich. (Disk is shared amongst all Nodes) then all 

Architecture: group of node working together as unified system 

Tyoes: 
1)Supercomputer: group of clusters
2)
3) Grid Computing


Key Idea: "CPU + Memory + Storage = Speed"

2. COMPONENTS OF HPC
---------------------
CNS = Compute + Network + Storage
- Compute: CPUs/GPUs
- Network: High-speed connection between nodes
- Storage: Fast, scalable data access

3. TYPES OF HPC CLUSTERS
-------------------------
"CD" = Cluster vs Distributed

- Cluster Computing:
  * Computers (nodes) placed close physically and in network.
  * Used for tightly coupled tasks.

- Distributed Computing:
  * Nodes across locations (on-prem or cloud).
  * Best for loosely coupled tasks.

4. WORKLOAD TYPES
------------------
"TLC" = Tightly coupled, Loosely coupled, Combination

- Loosely Coupled:
  * Independent tasks running in parallel (e.g. batch jobs)

- Tightly Coupled:
  * Tasks dependent on each other.
  * Needs low-latency network and shared memory.

5. COMPUTING STYLES
--------------------
"P.S.D" = Parallel, Serial, Distributed

- Parallel Computing:
  * Multiple processors work together to solve tasks.

- Serial Computing:
  * Single processor works step-by-step.

- Distributed Computing:
  * Multiple systems work together to complete a task.

6. JOB SCHEDULING
------------------
Job schedulers: SLURM, PBS, Torque
- Manages CPU, memory, GPU allocation
- Common SLURM commands: sbatch, squeue, scancel

7. REAL-WORLD USE CASES
------------------------
- Scientific: Climate modeling, genomics, physics
- Engineering: CFD, FEA
- AI/ML: Large-scale model training
- Finance: Risk analysis, simulations

8. HPC HARDWARE
----------------
- Multi-core CPUs, GPUs
- High-speed interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand)
- Shared or distributed memory
- Needs cooling, power, and rack management

9. HPC vs CLOUD COMPUTING
---------------------------
"Think LCSU: Latency, Cost, Scalability, Use"

| Feature       | HPC                         | Cloud Computing           |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Latency       | Very low (InfiniBand, etc.) | Higher (Internet)         |
| Cost Model    | CAPEX (hardware purchase)   | OPEX (pay-as-you-go)      |
| Scalability   | Limited by physical nodes   | Virtually unlimited       |
| Use Case      | Tightly coupled workloads   | Loosely coupled tasks     |

10. SOFTWARE IN HPC
---------------------
- Linux-based OS (CentOS, Rocky Linux)
- Dependency tools: modules, Singularity, Conda
- Programming: MPI, OpenMP

11. HPC NETWORKING
-------------------
- High-speed, low-latency (InfiniBand, Omni-Path)
- Network Topologies: Fat Tree, Torus, Dragonfly

12. PERFORMANCE METRICS
------------------------
- FLOPS = Floating Point Operations Per Second
- Other metrics: Latency, Throughput, Wait Time, CPU/GPU utilization
- Tools: Ganglia, Nagios, Grafana
