# ❌ Things iproute2 Does NOT Replace
# 🔧 But Still Important in Linux Networking
##########################################

==========================================
1️⃣ Firewall Management (Security)
==========================================
Tools:
- firewalld (recommended in RHEL/CentOS)
- nftables

KeyPoints:
-nftables = New & better Linux firewall (replaces iptables).
-Rules must be saved (/etc/nftables.conf) to survive reboot
-To reload the nftables rules after modifying the configuration file /etc/nftables.conf is:
 nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
-firewalld = A manager/tool that configures rules for you.
-nftables = The engine that actually executes those rules.

Notes:
- firewalld = frontend tool
- nftables = backend engine
- Save rules: nft -f /etc/nftables.conf

Examples:
firewall-cmd --list-all
nft list ruleset 



Why?
iproute2 does not handle packet filtering, port blocking, or stateful firewall logic.

==========================================
2️⃣ DNS Resolution Tools
==========================================
Tools:
- dig

Full Form: Domain Information Groper

What dig Does:
It sends a DNS query to a DNS server and shows the detailed response.
Detailed DNS queries & debugging

Examples:
dig google.com -p 80 
dig +stats example.com    >> To see which DNS server dig is using,
dig -x 8.8.8.8                 >> To perform a reverse lookup (finding the domain name associated with an IP address),
dig +trace google.com     >> showing how your query reaches the authoritative DNS servers

Why?
iproute2 only handles IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.1), not domain names (google.com).

How to Remember:

whether to use port or -p ?

port   → Filtering/raw protocols (tcpdump, firewall rules).

-p    → Most CLI tools (nmap, ssh, netcat).

==========================================
3️⃣ Packet Capture / Traffic Analysis
==========================================
Tools:
- tcpdump

Capture and analyze raw network traffic in real-time

It helps you:

Debug connectivity issues

Monitor live network traffic

Inspect packets for errors or security concerns

Analyze protocols (like HTTP, DNS, etc.)


⚠️ Notes
Run with sudo or root access.

Use filters to avoid capturing too much data.

Basic Syntax:
tcpdump [options] [filter]

Examples:
tcpdump -i eth0 port 80    (-i is for inspect)

Why?
iproute2 doesn’t capture packets.

==========================================
4️⃣ Network Scanning / Discovery
==========================================
Tool:
- nmap

What is nmap?
its Network Mapper, network scanning tool used to:

Discover hosts and devices on a network

Scan for open ports

Detect running services and versions

Identify the operating system

Perform basic vulnerability assessment

It’s a go-to tool for network administrators, security professionals, and penetration testers.
 
Basic Syntax:

nmap [options] [target]

Examples:

here -s is for scan

1. Ping Scan (find live hosts)
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

2. SYN Scan (Stealth Scan)
nmap -sS 192.168.1.100

3. TCP Connect Scan
nmap -sT 192.168.1.100

4. UDP Scan
nmap -sU 192.168.1.100

5. Service Version Detection
nmap -sV 192.168.1.100

6. Aggressive Scan (OS, version, script, traceroute)
nmap -A 192.168.1.100

7. Scan Specific Port
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.100

8. Scan All Ports
nmap -p- 192.168.1.100

9. Save Output in All Formats
nmap -oA scan_results 192.168.1.100

Why?
For discovering live hosts, scanning open ports, vulnerability checks — beyond iproute2's job.

When to Use nmap
"Who’s on my network?" → nmap 192.168.1.0/24

"Is my website port (80/443) open?"       → nmap -p 80,443 192.168.1.100

"Why can’t I connect to my linux server?" → nmap -p 22     192.168.1.100 

==========================================
5️⃣ DHCP / Dynamic IP Configuration
==========================================
Tools:
- NetworkManager

DHCP (dynamic IP) is handles by NetworkManager 

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

is task is to,

- Auto-assigns:
  ✅ IP address  
  ✅ Subnet mask  
  ✅ Gateway  
  ✅ DNS servers  

💡 Trick: Your PC gets IP info *automatically* from your DHCP server.


Why?
iproute2 configures static IPs. It cannot request IP from a DHCP server.

==========================================
6️⃣ Hostname & DNS Configuration
==========================================
Tools/Files:
- /etc/hosts
- /etc/resolv.conf
- hostnamectl

Examples:
hostnamectl set-hostname server1

here,
hostnamectl: The tool.

set-hostname: The command.

server1: The new hostname.

Why?
Name resolution setup (DNS servers, local hostnames) is outside iproute2’s role.


==========================================
7️⃣  NetworkManager Tools
==========================================
Tools:
- nmcli
&
-DHCP

✅ nmcli = Command-line version of your network settings.
✅ Controls Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPNs, hotspots.
✅ Works even without a GUI (great for servers)


>    Aspect                  	 device	                                con
What it represents	Hardware interface (e.g., eth0).	Software profile (e.g., "Home-WiFi").

Examples:
nmcli device show                 >> Displays detailed information about all network interfaces (devices).
nmcli device status               >> Shows a quick status overview of all network devices.
nmcli device connect eth0         >> Forces NetworkManager to activate/connect the Ethernet interface 
                                     eth0.
nmcli con show                    >> Lists all saved connection profiles.
nmcli con up "connection 1"       >> Activates (brings up) a specific named connection.
journalctl -u NetworkManager      >> Views logs for NetworkManager (useful for debugging).


Why?
Used in GUI systems for dynamic interface, DNS, and routing configuration — abstracted away from iproute2.



🚀 When to Use Which?
Debugging DNS? → dig

Checking open ports? → nmap

Inspecting live traffic? → tcpdump

Need a user-friendly firewall? → firewalld (RHEL)

Want granular firewall rules? → nftables

💡 Pro Tip
These tools work together! Example workflow:

Use dig to check DNS.

Use nmap to scan the target.

Use tcpdump to capture traffic.

Block unwanted traffic with nftables/firewalld.
