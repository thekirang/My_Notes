Linux User & Group Management 
============================

üë§ USER MANAGEMENT
------------------

=== Create User ===
useradd [username]                  # Basic user (no home dir)
useradd -m [username]               # With home directory (/home/username)
useradd -m -s /bin/bash [username]  # With home dir + Bash shell
useradd -u 1005 -g devs [username]  # Custom UID & primary group

=== Set/Change Password ===
passwd             # Change your own password
passwd [username]  # Set password (root required for others)

=== Modify User ===
usermod -l newname oldname       # Rename user
usermod -aG groupname username   # Add to group (preserves existing groups)
usermod -G groupname username    # Keep this group only and removes from all secondary group memberships.
usermod -L username              # Lock account
usermod -U username              # Unlock account

üí° Memory Trick:
- "-aG = Append to Group (without -a, it removes other groups!)"
- "mod -aG" = Append groups
- "mod -G" = Overwrite groups

=== Delete User ===
userdel [username]     # Delete user (keeps home dir)
userdel -r [username]  # Delete user + home dir (irreversible!)


üë• GROUP MANAGEMENT
-------------------

=== Create Group ===
groupadd [groupname]
groupadd -g 1234 [groupname]  # Custom GID

üí° Memory Trick:
- "aG = append to group"
- Don't forget `-a` or you'll remove user from other secondary groups!

Example:
usermod -aG devteam alice  # Add alice to group 'devteam'

=== Remove User from Group ===
gpasswd -d [username] [groupname]
Example:
gpasswd -d alice devteam

=== Change Primary Group ===
usermod -g [new_primary_group] [username]

‚ùó Don‚Äôt confuse with:
usermod -G groupname username
- -g = Primary group (used for file ownership) and GID
- -G = Secondary groups (additional) in usermod only

=== View Groups ===
groups [username]       # Show user's groups
id [username]           # Show UID, GID, and group IDs
getent group            # List all system groups
cat /etc/group          # Alternative method

=== Delete Group ===
groupdel [groupname]


üîê PASSWORD AGING (chage)
-------------------------
chage -l [username]          # Check current policy
chage -M 30 [username]       # Max days between password changes
chage -m 7 [username]        # Min days before password change
chage -W 5 [username]        # Warn user 5 days before expiry
chage -d 0 [username]        # Force password reset on next login

üí° Memory Trick:
"M-m-W" = Max, min, Warn



üßë‚Äçüíº sudo & su
--------------

=== Switch User (su) ===
su - [username]     # Login as user (load environment)
su -                # Become root (needs root password)

=== Grant sudo Access ===

Method 1: Add User to the 'wheel' Group (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------
sudo usermod -aG wheel [username]

- In RHEL 8+, the 'wheel' group is pre-configured for sudo access.
- After adding, user must re-login for changes to apply.
- By default, user must enter **their own password** when using sudo.

Group-based Example:
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL   # Passwordless sudo for all wheel group users

‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution ‚Äî only if you trust the user and want convenience.

Method 2: Edit sudoers File via visudo (Advanced)
-------------------------------------------------
sudo visudo

This opens /etc/sudoers safely to avoid syntax errors.

Example Entry:
username ALL=(ALL) ALL

This gives the user full sudo access on all hosts.

üìò Sudoers Syntax:
<user> <host> = (<runas>) <options>: <commands>

  - <user>    = Who the rule applies to
  - <host>    = On which machines (usually ALL)
  - (<runas>) = Which user(s) commands can run as (usually ALL)
  - <options> = Optional flags (e.g., NOPASSWD: )
  - <commands>= Allowed commands (ALL = any command)


Key Difference: sudo vs su
--------------------------
- sudo [command] = Run a single command as root (needs user‚Äôs password)
- su -           = Switch to root shell (needs root password)



üìú QUICK REFERENCE TABLE
------------------------
| Task                      | Command                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Create user with home dir | useradd -m -s /bin/bash alice    |
| Add to group              | usermod -aG devs alice           |
| Lock account              | usermod -L alice                 |
| List groups               | groups alice                     |
| Force password reset      | chage -d 0 alice                 |
| Delete user + home dir    | userdel -r alice                 |



üéØ MEMORY TRICKS SUMMARY
------------------------
1. User: "add -m, mod -aG, del -r" = Create, Modify, Delete
2. Groups: "-aG = Append (no -a = overwrite!)"
3. chage: "M-m-W" = Max, min, Warn
4. groupadd = add new crew
5. gpasswd -d = delete user from group
6. -g = primary group, -G = secondary groups
7. groups = show all groups of user
