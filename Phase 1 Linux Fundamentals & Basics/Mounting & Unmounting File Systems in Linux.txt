Mounting with Options You can specify various options when mounting. Some common ones include:

-o: Specify mount options (e.g., read-only).
ro: Mount the filesystem as read-only.
rw: Mount the filesystem with read-write access.
noexec: Do not allow execution of binaries on the filesystem.
Example:
 mount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt


Unmounting a Filesystem

umount /mnt

Auto-Mounting with /etc/fstab 
You can configure filesystems to mount automatically at boot by editing the /etc/fstab file. 
Each line corresponds to a filesystem and its mount options. 
Example entry:

/dev/sda1   /mnt   ext4   defaults   0   2     (here first 0 is used for dump to avoid backup, if want backup then use 1)  then 2nd for below reason

Fsck Order:

0: Skip checking (e.g., for virtual filesystems)

1: Check first (reserved for root /)

2: Check after root (standard for non-root partitions)



for NFS 

mount -t nfs server:/share /mnt/nfs     # here -t is for type
