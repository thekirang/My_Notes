Hadoop: 
Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets, commonly referred to as big data


HADOOP COMPONENTS OVERVIEW
==========================

NAMENODE
--------
- Keeps track of which file is stored on which DataNodes (does not store actual data).
- Stores metadata such as file permissions, directory structure, and replication information.
- When a user wants to read/write a file, the NameNode provides the location of the data.
- If the NameNode fails, the entire HDFS becomes unavailable.

DATANODE (STORES ACTUAL DATA)
-----------------------------
- A worker node that stores actual data blocks.
- Works under the control of the NameNode.
- Sends regular heartbeats to the NameNode to indicate it's alive.
- If a DataNode fails, the NameNode initiates replication from other DataNodes.

SIMPLE ANALOGY: HDFS AS A LIBRARY
---------------------------------
- NameNode = Librarian (keeps catalog/index but doesn’t hold books).
- DataNodes = Bookshelves (store actual books/files).

SECONDARY NAMENODE
------------------
- Not a backup for the NameNode!
- Periodically saves metadata snapshots and merges edit logs with the file system image.
- Helps reduce load on the NameNode and aids in faster recovery.
- Does not take over if the NameNode crashes.
- Analogy: Like a backup assistant librarian who organizes catalog updates for reference.

BACKUP NODE
-----------
- An active backup of the NameNode.
- Maintains a real-time copy of the NameNode’s metadata.
- Can take over immediately if the NameNode fails.
- Analogy: A co-librarian with a live mirror of the records.

EDGE NODE
---------
- Acts as a gateway for external applications to interact with the Hadoop ecosystem.
- Typically where client tools and scripts run.

--------------------------------------------------

APACHE SPARK
============
- A powerful distributed computing engine for big data processing.
- Uses in-memory computing whenever possible for speed.
- Up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in certain cases.
- Especially effective for iterative algorithms (e.g., machine learning).

--------------------------------------------------

YARN WORKFLOW (SIMPLIFIED)
==========================

1) Submit your application to the ResourceManager.
2) ResourceManager allocates a dedicated ApplicationMaster for your job.
3) ApplicationMaster analyzes the job and requests required resources (CPU, memory).
4) ResourceManager assigns containers after considering resource availability.
5) ApplicationMaster coordinates with NodeManagers to start containers.
6) Your application runs inside these containers, processing data.
7) ApplicationMaster monitors execution, handles failures, and may request more resources.
8) Once completed, ApplicationMaster notifies the ResourceManager and releases containers.

--------------------------------------------------

THE BIG PICTURE: HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER
=========================================

- DATA STORAGE LAYER:
    * HDFS stores large-scale datasets across many machines.

- RESOURCE MANAGEMENT LAYER:
    * YARN allows multiple data processing applications to share cluster resources efficiently.

- PROCESSING FRAMEWORKS:
    * Spark, MapReduce, and others perform distributed computation.

- DATA ACCESS LAYER:
    * Hive, HBase, and Pig allow users to interact with the data in different ways.

- COORDINATION SERVICES:
    * ZooKeeper ensures distributed services operate in sync and handle failure gracefully.

- DATA MOVEMENT TOOLS:
    * Flume, Kafka, and Sqoop help ingest/export data to/from the Hadoop ecosystem.

- WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT:
    * Oozie automates and manages complex data processing pipelines.

FINAL THOUGHTS
--------------
- Hadoop’s power lies in its ecosystem, not just one component.
- Each tool solves a specific problem in big data management and processing.
- Mastering Hadoop means understanding which tools to use for which tasks.
