Shortest Steps:

ssh-keygen                        #Generate Key on Master         
ssh-copy-id username@remote_ip    #Copy key from master to remote   
ssh username@remote_ip            #Test ssh from master to remote   
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Detailed Steps:
Passwordless Authentication:

sudo su - root
yum update -y

Then switch to the ec2-user:


sudo su - ec2-user


### 2. Generate and Configure SSH Key (On Master)
Generate an SSH key pair on the master server:


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

It will:

Prompt you to enter the file path (default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa)

Ask for a passphrase (you can press Enter for none — to make it passwordless)



Display the public key:


cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the displayed key.

### 3. Configure SSH Access (On Remote Server)
On the remote server (172.31.5.65), run:


mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  then paste copied key

or 

vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Paste the copied public key of Grafana master into Remote server's `authorized_keys`.

Then, set the correct permissions:


chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Restart SSH to apply changes:


sudo systemctl restart sshd


### 4. Test SSH Connection (From Master)
Back on the master server, test the connection:


ssh ec2-user@172.31.5.65   (public key)


If it connects without a password, SSH key authentication is correctly set up. ✅
