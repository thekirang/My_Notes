APACHE SPARK
============
- apache spark is the distributed processing engine designed for large-scale data processing is used due to its in-memory computation capabilities
- Reads Dataframe and handles the data processing logic 
- Used for Data Tranformation
- Up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in certain cases.
- Especially effective for iterative algorithms (e.g., machine learning).

# Apache Spark: Essential Notes

## What is Apache Spark?

- Apache Spark is a distributed processing engine designed for large-scale data processing.
- It is widely adopted for its in-memory (RAM used for this) computation capabilities, which make data processing much faster compared to traditional disk-based systems.

## Key Features

- Distributed Processing: Spark runs on clusters, allowing it to handle massive datasets efficiently.
- In-Memory Computation: Processes data in memory, greatly reducing the time needed for read/write operations.
- DataFrame Support: Reads and processes data using DataFrames, enabling high-level, SQL-like operations on structured data.
- Data Transformation: Spark is ideal for transforming data, making it suitable for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.
- Iterative Algorithms: Particularly effective for workloads that require repeated data access, such as machine learning and graph processing.
- Versatility: Supports batch processing, real-time streaming, interactive queries, and machine learning tasks.
- Ease of Use: Provides APIs in Python, Scala, Java, and R, with concise, high-level commands for data manipulation.
- Scalability: Can scale from a single machine to thousands of nodes, processing petabytes of data.

## When to Use Apache Spark

- When you need to process large datasets quickly.
- For projects involving machine learning or algorithms that require multiple passes over data.
- When real-time or streaming data analytics are required.
- If you want a modern, flexible, and actively developed big data platform.

🔁 Quick Flow Recap (Layman Style):
Driver: "Here's a job. Let me figure out how to do it (DAG)."

Driver → Cluster Manager: "I need servers to run this job."

Cluster Manager: "Okay, I found 10 servers. Executors launched."

Driver → Executors: "Each of you take a piece of this data and process it like this..."

Executors: "Done! Here's the result."

Driver: "Thanks. Job complete."

----------------------------

procedure:

Spark driver starts the application and analyzes the code.

Driver creates a DAG (execution plan) for the job.

Spark reads metadata and splits the 100 GB file into 800 partitions (e.g., 128 MB each).

Cluster manager allocates executors (workers) on 10 servers.

Each executor picks and processes assigned data partitions in parallel.

Transformations (like map/filter) run locally per partition without shuffling.

Actions (like groupBy/join) trigger a shuffle to redistribute data across executors.

Final results are combined and sent to the driver or written to storage.

Spark releases resources and ends the job.
