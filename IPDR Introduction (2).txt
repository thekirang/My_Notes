My current job depends on a client project, and it's not clear if the contract will be renewed. So, I'm looking for a more stable role where I can grow and build my career long-term




"In my current role, we have Hadoop cluster consisting of 99 nodes, 
with a total storage capacity of around 10 petabytes.
 To effectively monitor the health and performance of the cluster,
 we’ve integrated Grafana as our primary monitoring tool. 
In Grafana, we keep an eye on data loading, writing, and extraction activities to ensure everything is functioning smoothly.

I’ve been actively involved during go-live activities at multiple sites,
 where I was responsible for validating incoming data formats

We’ve also structured our data pipeline using clearly defined landing and reconciliation paths. 
The reconciliation path, for instance, is used to validate the receipt of files — typically around 100 files — sent by the SNOC or collector nodes.

I handle collector-wise data for sources like CGF, CGNAT, and EDR, which we store in Hadoop’s Hive tables.
 For further processing, especially for the nodal teams, we utilize Apache Spark jobs to transform and prepare the data as per their requirements.

These Spark jobs are orchestrated and scheduled using Apache Airflow, which helps automate workflows and 
ensures timely execution and monitoring of all jobs."
