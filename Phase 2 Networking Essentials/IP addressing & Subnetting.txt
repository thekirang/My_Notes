## Types of Addresses
**1. Physical Address** - The hardware address assigned to a device (e.g., MAC address). Used for communication within a local network.  
**2. Logical Address** - Assigned by software (e.g., IP address). Enables devices to communicate across different networks.  

## Types of Logical Addresses
- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**  
- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**

## IPv4 Addressing

**Structure:**  
- 32 bits total, divided into 4 octets (8 bits each)  
- Each octet ranges from 0 to 255  
- Format: `192.168.39.240` (dotted decimal)  
- Binary format: `11000000.10101000.00100111.11110000`  

**Components:**  
- Network bits + Host bits = 32 bits  
- Example: In `192.168.39.240`, each number is one octet

### IPv4 Address Classes

| Class | Range (First Octet)  | Network.Host Structure  | Typical Use              |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| A     | 1 – 126              | N.H.H.H                 | Large networks           |
| B     | 128 – 191            | N.N.H.H                 | Medium-sized networks    |
| C     | 192 – 223            | N.N.N.H                 | Small networks           |
| D     | 224 – 239            | Multicast               | Multicasting             |
| E     | 240 – 254            | Experimental            | Research/Experimental    |

- 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback (localhost)  

**Identifying the Class:**  
- Check the first octet of the IP address and match it to the ranges above.

### Private IPv4 Address Ranges

| Class | Private Range                      |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| A     | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255          |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255        |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255      |

### Binary Representation Example  
To convert `192.168.31.200` to binary:

| Octet | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-------|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| 192   | 1   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 168   | 1   | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 31    | 0   | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 200   | 1   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

So, in binary: `11000000.10101000.00011111.11001000`

### Network ID and Broadcast ID  

**Finding the Network ID:**  
1. Identify the class.  
2. For the network part, keep the relevant octets; set the host part to zero.  

**Example:**  
- IP: 150.10.20.30 (Class B)  
- Network ID: 150.10.0.0  
- Broadcast ID: 150.10.255.255  
- Usable hosts: 2^16 - 2 = 65,534  

---

### Subnet Mask  
- Used to distinguish the network and host portions of an IP address.  
- Example for Class A: `255.0.0.0` (binary: `11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000`)  
- Example for Class B: `255.255.0.0` (binary: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`)  

---

### Subnetting  

**Purpose:**  
- To efficiently use IP address space and avoid wastage.  
- Subnetting divides a network into smaller, logical sub-networks.

## IPv6 Addressing  

**Key Features:**  
- 128 bits, written as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`)  
- Vast address space (over 3.4 × 10^38 addresses)  
- No need for NAT (Network Address Translation)  
- Built-in security (IPsec), QoS, and more efficient routing  

**Comparison Table: IPv4 vs IPv6**

| Feature               | IPv4                          | IPv6                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Address Length       | 32 bits (4 octets)            | 128 bits (8 groups)                    |
| Address Format       | Decimal, separated by dots    | Hexadecimal, separated by colons      |
| Example              | 192.168.1.1                   | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 |
| Address Space        | ~4.3 billion                  | Over 3.4 × 10^38                        |
| NAT Required         | Yes (for private networks)    | No (globally unique addresses)         |
| Security             | Optional (IPsec can be added) | Built-in IPsec                         |
| Broadcast            | Yes                           | No (uses multicast)                    |
| Header Complexity    | Simple                        | More complex, but efficient            |

## Summary  

- **Physical addresses** are hardware-based, while **logical addresses** (IP addresses) allow devices to communicate across networks.  
- **IPv4** is 32-bit, divided into classes (A–E), with private and public ranges, and uses subnet masks to separate network and host portions.  
- **IPv6** is 128-bit, uses hexadecimal notation, and solves address exhaustion while adding security and efficiency features.  
- **Subnetting** helps manage IP address allocation and network segmentation.

## ######### How to find Subnet Mask, BLOCK SIZE, NID, BID #########

Step 1: Understand the IP & CIDR  
IP = 192.168.100.128/26 → first 26 bits are network (3 full octets + 2 bits in 4th)  

Step 2: Calculate Subnet Mask  
First 3 octets = 255.255.255  
Add first two bits in 4th octet: 128 + 64 = 192  
→ Subnet mask = 255.255.255.192  

Step 3: Calculate Block Size  
Block size = 256 - 192 = 64 (in 4th octet)  

Step 4: Find the Network ID (NID)  
As block size is 64, then write multiples of 64:  
64, 128, 192, 248  
Now check in which two values the last octet of subnet lies → it's 128 and 192  
Take the first value as NID  
→ Network ID (NID) = 192.168.100.128  

Step 5: Find the Broadcast ID (BID)  
192.168.100.(192 - 1)  
→ BID = 192.168.100.191  

Step 6: Find First and Last Usable IP  
First host: NID + 1 = 192.168.100.129  
Last host: BID - 1 = 192.168.100.190  

---

Example: 172.16.44.200/20  
Subnet mask: 255.255.240.0  
Block size = 256 - 240 = 16  
Multiples: 16, 32, 48, 64  
→ 44 lies between 32 and 48  
NID: 172.16.32.0  
BID: 172.16.47.255  

---

Example: 10.10.128.1/18  
Subnet mask: 255.255.192.0  
Block size: 256 - 192 = 64  
Multiples: 64, 128, 192, 248  
NID: 10.10.128.0  
BID: 10.10.191.255  

---

Example: 192.168.50.100/22  
Subnet mask: 255.255.252.0  
Block size: 256 - 252 = 4  
Multiples: 4, 8, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56  
NID: 192.168.48.0  
BID: 192.168.52.255
