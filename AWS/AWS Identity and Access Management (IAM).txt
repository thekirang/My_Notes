What is AWS IAM?

IAM acts like an administrator for your AWS environment:

It manages permissions by allowing you to define which users, groups, or roles can access specific AWS resources 
and what actions they can perform.

You, as an AWS administrator, use IAM to create users, assign them to groups, 
and attach policies that grant or restrict access.

This centralized control ensures that only authorized individuals or applications can access 
or modify AWS resources, following the principle of least privilege.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) determines who is authorized to use which AWS resources
 and what actions they can perform on those resources.

IAM manages identities (users, groups, roles) and their permissions.

Policies attached to these identities define what AWS services and resources they can access,
 and what operations (read, write, delete, etc.) they are allowed or denied to perform.

This ensures secure and controlled access to all AWS resources in your account.

Core Components
Component	         Description
Root User	  >       The initial identity with full access to all AWS resources. Should not be used for daily tasks.
IAM User	  >       Individual identity with specific permissions. Used for people or applications.
IAM Group	  >       Collection of users with shared permissions. Easier to manage access for multiple users.
IAM Role	  >       Temporary permissions for users or AWS services to perform specific tasks.
Policy	          >       what should be allowd , JSON document defining permissions attached to users, groups, or roles.
Federation        >       Allows external identities (e.g., corporate directory, social login) to access AWS.

üîë IAM Policy = What actions are allowed, 
üîë IAM Role = Who can temporarily get those permissions, Temporary identity	It gets temporary credentials (for 1 hour, 12 hours, etc.)

‚úÖ Your Scenario:
You created an IAM Policy that allows:
‚úÖ EC2 Full Access
‚úÖ S3 Full Access

You attached this Policy to a User or User Group.

Now you're asking:
"Can that user access S3 from the EC2 instance?"

‚úÖ The Correct Answer:
üëâ If that user logs in to the AWS Console Dashboard or uses AWS CLI from their own laptop:
‚úÖ Yes, they can launch EC2 instances and also access S3 (because their user has both permissions).

But...

üëâ If that user SSHs into an EC2 instance and tries to run aws s3 ls from inside the EC2 machine:
‚ùå No... Not automatically.

Why?
Because inside the EC2 instance, the permissions depend on what Role (if any) is attached to the EC2 instance, 
not what the user's IAM permissions are.

‚úÖ So in your case:
If the user wants EC2 to access S3 from inside the instance:
‚úÖ You must assign an IAM Role to the EC2 instance that has S3 access policy attached.

‚úÖ If you skip Role:
If EC2 has no role attached, then from inside EC2 instance:
Running aws s3 ls ‚Üí ‚ùå Will fail ‚Üí "Unable to locate credentials" error

| Scenario                                         | Access                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| User sitting at laptop, using AWS CLI or Console | User needs IAM Policy                     |
| EC2 instance accessing S3 via CLI or Application | EC2 needs an IAM Role with S3 permissions |


Key Features
Fine-Grained Access Control: Grant permissions to specific resources and actions.

Centralized Management: Create, manage, and audit users, roles, and permissions from one place.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security for users.

Temporary Credentials: Grant time-limited access for users, applications, or services.

No Additional Cost: IAM is included free with your AWS account.

Integration: Works with all AWS services for unified access control

How IAM Works
Authentication:
User/application signs in with credentials (password, access keys, or federated identity).

Authorization:
IAM checks attached policies to determine what actions are allowed or denied.

By default, all requests are denied except for the root user.

Explicit allow in a policy grants access; explicit deny always overrides allow.

Action:
Once authorized, the principal can perform actions on AWS resources (e.g., launch EC2, access S3).

Best Practices
Avoid using the root user for daily tasks; create individual IAM users.

Grant least privilege: Only give users the permissions they need to perform their job.

Use groups and roles instead of assigning permissions directly to users.

Enable MFA for all users, especially those with privileged access.

Regularly review and audit permissions and access logs.

Use managed policies rather than inline policies for easier management.

Rotate access keys and passwords regularly.

Leverage temporary credentials and roles for applications and cross-account access.

Common IAM Use Cases
Securely provide access to AWS resources for team members, applications, or external partners.

Enforce compliance and security policies across AWS accounts.

Enable single sign-on (SSO) and federated access for corporate users.

Audit and monitor resource usage and access patterns.

IAM is foundational for AWS security and resource management. Mastering IAM ensures secure, scalable, and compliant operations in the cloud.
