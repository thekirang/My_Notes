# **AWS Scalable Web Setup (July 2025) – Quick Steps**

for memorise: 

✅ What Happens When a Request Comes In (Step-by-Step Flow)
Request comes to ALB (Load Balancer)
🔁 It forwards the request to the Target Group.

Target Group has one or more EC2 instances (from ASG)
⚙️ If the current instance is under high load (e.g., CPU > 70%), it may slow down.

CloudWatch Alarm detects high CPU usage
📈 Based on configured metric (e.g., CPU > 70% for 2 mins), CloudWatch triggers:

A signal to the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to scale out.

A notification to SNS, which sends an email alert.

ASG launches a new EC2 instance
🚀 Using the Launch Template, ASG automatically adds the new instance to the Target Group.

ALB detects the new instance (via health checks)
✅ Once healthy, ALB starts forwarding incoming requests to the new instance as well.


# **AWS Scalable Web Setup (July 2025) – Quick Steps**

1. **EC2 Instance**

   * Launch Amazon Linux 2 with Apache via User Data
   * Name it `My-ASG-Template`
   * Security Group: Allow SSH (22) + HTTP (80)

2. **Launch Template**

   * Create Launch Template using EC2 settings
   * Name: `My-ASG-Template`

3. **Target Group**

   * Type: **Instance**, Protocol: HTTP (port 80)
   * Name: `MyTargetGroup`
   * Health check path: `/`
   * Skip target registration (ASG will attach instances)

4. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

   * Name: `MyALB`, internet-facing
   * Listener: HTTP (port 80)
   * Select 2+ subnets across different AZs
   * Attach `MyTargetGroup`

5. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

   * Name: `MyASG`, use Launch Template
   * VPC: Default VPC, 2+ subnets
   * Attach to ALB using `MyTargetGroup`
   * Min: 1, Desired: 1, Max: 3

6. **CloudWatch Alarm**

   * Metric: CPUUtilization > 70% for 2 periods
   * Action: Trigger **ASG scale-out** and notify **SNS (`HighCPUAlert`)**

7. **SNS Topic & Subscription**

   * Create topic `HighCPUAlert`
   * Add email subscription → confirm email

8. **Scaling Policy**

   * Attach **Target Tracking Policy** to ASG at 70% CPU

9. **Test the Setup**

   * SSH to EC2 → install `stress`
   * Run: `stress --cpu 2 --timeout 300`
   * Observe scale-out, CloudWatch Alarm, SNS email
