APACHE SPARK
============
- apache spark is the distributed processing engine designed for large-scale data processing is used due to its in-memory computation capabilities
- Reads Dataframe and handles the data processing logic 
- Used for Data Tranformation
- Up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in certain cases.
- Especially effective for iterative algorithms (e.g., machine learning).

# Apache Spark: Essential Notes

## What is Apache Spark?

- Apache Spark is a distributed processing engine designed for large-scale data processing.
- It is widely adopted for its in-memory computation capabilities, which make data processing much faster compared to traditional disk-based systems.

## Key Features

- Distributed Processing: Spark runs on clusters, allowing it to handle massive datasets efficiently.
- In-Memory Computation: Processes data in memory, greatly reducing the time needed for read/write operations.
- DataFrame Support: Reads and processes data using DataFrames, enabling high-level, SQL-like operations on structured data.
- Data Transformation: Spark is ideal for transforming data, making it suitable for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.
- Iterative Algorithms: Particularly effective for workloads that require repeated data access, such as machine learning and graph processing.
- Versatility: Supports batch processing, real-time streaming, interactive queries, and machine learning tasks.
- Ease of Use: Provides APIs in Python, Scala, Java, and R, with concise, high-level commands for data manipulation.
- Scalability: Can scale from a single machine to thousands of nodes, processing petabytes of data.

## When to Use Apache Spark

- When you need to process large datasets quickly.
- For projects involving machine learning or algorithms that require multiple passes over data.
- When real-time or streaming data analytics are required.
- If you want a modern, flexible, and actively developed big data platform.
