1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with the actual physical connection between devices, like cables or wireless signals.

2. **Data Link Layer**: Handles how data is sent over the physical connection, including addressing and error detection.

3. **Network Layer**: Takes care of finding the best path for data to travel through different networks using addresses (like IP addresses).

4. **Transport Layer**: Manages how data is sent and received between devices reliably and accurately. segmentation of data is carried out here

5. **Session Layer**: Sets up and maintains connections between applications on different devices.

6. **Presentation Layer**: Deals with how data is formatted, encrypted, or compressed for transmission.

7. **Application Layer**: Provides interfaces for software applications to use network services like email or web browsing.

Each layer builds on the one below it, making sure data travels smoothly from one device to another across networks, like a step-by-step instruction manual for communication.
