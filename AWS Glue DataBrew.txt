1. What is AWS Glue DataBrew?

>AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual, no-code data preparation tool 
that allows you to clean, normalize, and transform data for analytics and machine learning—without writing code.

>It supports over 250 pre-built transformations
 (e.g., removing duplicates, normalizing data, standardizing formats, filtering, aggregating).

>DataBrew integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog, S3, Redshift, RDS, and more.

3. How Does DataBrew Work?
Set Up: Ensure you have an AWS account, proper IAM roles, and permissions for DataBrew.

Create a Project:

Open DataBrew in the AWS Console.

Create a new project, attach a recipe, and select a dataset (from S3, Redshift, etc.).

Data Exploration:

Preview a sample of your data (default: first 500 rows).

Use the toolbar to apply transformations (filtering, joining, splitting, aggregating, etc.).

Build Recipes:

Each transformation is added as a step in your recipe.

Recipes can have up to 100 steps and are versioned for reuse.

Run Jobs:

Apply recipes to full datasets by running jobs.

Results can be exported to S3, Redshift, etc., for further analysis or ML.

Automate & Schedule:

Schedule jobs for recurring data preparation tasks.

4. Typical DataBrew Interview Topics
Primary Use Cases: Data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis.

Transformations: Know common actions—filtering, deduplication, string manipulation, joins, aggregations.

Recipes: How to create, version, and reuse recipes; difference between interactive and job-based application.

Integration: How DataBrew fits into a broader AWS analytics pipeline (e.g., S3 → DataBrew → Glue ETL → Redshift/QuickSight).

Security: Role of IAM, encryption, and access control.

Troubleshooting: How to handle errors, monitor job performance, and optimize workflows.

5. Example Workflow (Practical Steps)
Import Data: Load a dataset from S3.

Explore & Clean: Use the visual interface to:

Remove nulls

Deduplicate records

Standardize date formats

Split/merge columns

Encode categorical variables

Build & Save Recipe: Each step is tracked; publish the recipe for version control.

Run & Export: Apply the recipe to the full dataset and export the clean data to S3 or Redshift.

Schedule Jobs: Set up recurring jobs for new incoming data.

AWS Glue DataBrew typically imports data from sources like Amazon S3 (as well as Redshift, RDS, or JDBC sources), 
then allows you to visually clean, transform, and normalize that data using a no-code interface. Once the data is prepared,
 DataBrew exports the transformed output back to Amazon S3 or to other destinations such as Amazon Redshift 
 for further analytics or machine learning workflows
